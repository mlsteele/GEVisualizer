GE Visualization Tool

-- Files & Directories:
ofMap/ (incomplete listing)
  src/ - source files
  bin/
    data/ - layout configuration, general configuration, fonts
  mock.graffle - omnigraffle mockup of UI
  ofMap.xcodeproj - xcode project to build project


-- Compilation Notes

Dependencies
- OpenFrameworks
- Boost (has been tested with the version "#define BOOST_VERSION 105200")
- ofxUI (which should live in the OF addons folder, a copy is in ofMap/bin/data just in case)

You will likely have to change the xcode project to point to your installation
of openframeworks as this project did not live in the standard OF subdirectory
on my development machine.

src/XMLReader may conflict with the xml OF addon. The xml addon is not
required for this project.

Only the debug target has been tested.


-- Running Notes
Settings including server locations are stored in ofMap/bin/data/VisConfig.txt


-- Floor Data
Floor layout data is located in ofMap/bin/data

Each layout is comprised of three files:
- A PDF from MIT's online resources. This is not used by the program.
- An SVG which was traced in illustrator and contains the basic wall structure of the floor.
- A .TXT which describes location position and orientation as well as names the paired SVG file


-- Development Notes
Some quick things you might want to play with:
UI Layout -> instance variables in src/LayoutApp/LayoutApp.h
Layout Panes -> separate .cpp files in src/LayoutApp

The majority of the drawing code lives in LayoutRenderer.render, which seems too big
for its own good. Refactoring that function might make life a lot easier down the road.

Run doxygen from the ofMap directory to generate html automatic documentation.
The source contains no comments which are formatted for doxygen, so it will be less
instructive, but perhaps easier to browse for an overview of class properties.


-- Future Features
re-enable texture drawing
render look-ahead
show elevator position / movement (between floors)
